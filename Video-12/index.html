    <h1>BMI Calculator</h1>
    <p>
        A BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator is a tool that helps individuals estimate their body fat based on their height and weight. 
        It provides a simple numeric result that can indicate whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. 
        The formula used to calculate BMI is:
    </p>
    <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">
        BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) Ã— height (m))
    </p>
    <p>
        BMI is widely used in healthcare to assess an individual's health status and identify potential weight-related issues. 
        While it's a useful guideline, it doesn't directly measure body fat or take into account muscle mass, bone density, or overall body composition.
    </p>
    <p>
        A BMI calculator can be found in many health apps, websites, or created using simple programming tools like Python or JavaScript.
        It's an essential and easy-to-use feature for anyone wanting to track their health and fitness journey.
