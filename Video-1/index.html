    <h1>History of Python</h1>
    <p>
      Python was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s as a hobby project 
      to keep himself occupied during the Christmas season.

    <p>
      The name "Python" was inspired by the British comedy series 
      <em>Monty Python's Flying Circus</em>.
